            The response is a dictionary with a single entry:
            - `board`: A 6x7 grid (as a list of lists) representing the game board.

            **Response Details**: 
            The response contains:
            - a dictionary which contains a single key-value pair whose key is `board`.
            - The value represents the current state of the game board. It is a
              list containing 6 lists, each of which contain 7 strings. Each
              string represents a game token:
                - `'X'`: Player token for red.
                - `'0'`: Player token for yellow.
                - `' '`: An empty cell.

            *Example*:
            ```json
            {
                "board": [
                    [' ',' ',' ',' ',' ',' ',' '],
